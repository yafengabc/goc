//
// The C runtime on disk.
//
// goc used to carry the whole C library inside the executable: //go:embed
// baked goclib/*.c and goclib/*.h into the binary, and the loader read them
// back out of an embed.FS. That made goc a single self-contained file -- carry
// the exe and you can compile C -- and it is the reason goclib/ and the
// compiler could never be separated into two projects.
//
// The split into goc and gocl needs the library to be an input both compilers
// read the same way, so it is loaded from disk instead. The cost is stated
// plainly because it is real: **goc.exe is no longer self-contained.** Copied
// away from its goclib/ directory it fails on the first program that calls
// anything, with a diagnostic naming the missing library -- not a silent wrong
// answer, but not a working compiler either. goclib/ therefore has to travel
// with the binary, and any packaging that ships a compiler has to ship it too.
//
// The lookup order is deliberate. GOCLIB_PATH wins so a distribution can point
// at a shared library copy, and so the test suite can build a second compiler
// against a different tree. After that the search runs from the directory
// holding the running executable, and then from the working directory -- a
// developer running `go run ./goc` or `go test` gets a different origin than
// one running the installed binary, and both have to work.
//
// Each origin is searched by probe, which alternates descending and climbing.
// See probe for why one direction alone is not enough.
//
// Everything below the found root is read as a plain directory: the calls are
// on the same "goclib/<name>" spelling the embed version used, so the call
// sites did not change.

// goclibRootEnv names the environment variable that overrides the search.
const goclibRootEnv = "GOCLIB_PATH"

// libSource is where the C library comes from. Two implementations satisfy it:
// sourceFS below, which reads a goclib/ directory from disk, and the embed.FS
// an entry point injects so its binary needs nothing beside it.
//
// The interface is deliberately narrow -- read one file, list one directory --
// and its ReadDir returns names, not fs.DirEntry. That is what lets an
// embed.FS satisfy it without a wrapper: embed.FS's directory entries and the
// disk ones are different types, and normalising to a name list is the point
// at which they become interchangeable.
//
// Errors keep the shape the callers already handle: the preprocessor skips an
// unavailable header rather than failing, and it does that by testing
// err == nil. A missing file on disk and a missing file in an embed are
// indistinguishable there, which is the behaviour we want.
// sourceFS reads the library from a directory on disk.
