// One generator owns every C function in the program -- the user's and the C
// runtime's alike -- and goa's own assembler is left with the entry stub, which
// is not C at all: it establishes the process stack per the platform ABI before
// main runs. The split is therefore between two different *kinds* of code rather
// than two compilers racing over the same symbols.
//
// That is a change from an earlier arrangement where each function went to
// whichever generator could handle it. Sharing a program that way needs a symbol
// table in both, and they disagreed: over a global's assembler-level name, over
// whether an undefined symbol was an import or something the other half already
// defined, and over the variadic calls the native path rewrites by inspecting a
// format string. Every one of those produced either a link error or a silently
// wrong answer.

// translateProgram lowers a whole program to one LLVM IR module: the user's
// globals, the user's functions, and every C runtime function the program reaches.
//
// lib is the parsed C runtime; a nil lib means "user code only" (used by the unit
// tests, which exercise fragments without the runtime present). Its function table
// is consulted for prototypes and for the reachability walk that decides which
// runtime code has to be emitted.
// softFloatBuiltins are the compiler-rt helpers a target without floating-point
// registers needs. LLVM names them when it lowers `double` arithmetic, a
// double-to-integer conversion, or a 64-bit division -- none of which appear as
// a call in the source, so they have to be requested by name rather than
// reached. The list is the set libgcc's soft-float library provides for the
// operations goc's own runtime performs; a name that is missing shows up as an
// undefined symbol naming it, which is a link error rather than a wrong answer.
//
// The `__*df2` family is the comparison set (each returns 0 or 1, matching what
// an `fcmp`/`cset` pair expects); the `__*df3` family is arithmetic; the
// conversions bridge both directions between `double` and the 64-bit integers.
