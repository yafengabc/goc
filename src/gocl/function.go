// The type analysis, name resolution and scope handling are NOT reimplemented

// and the assembly generator draw on, so the two back ends never disagree about

// and changes only where the bytes go: instead of appending to the instruction
// stream that becomes assembly, it appends IR text.
//
// The result is that a function can move between the two back ends without
// either one having a different idea of what the program means.
